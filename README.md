# Snake_Water_Gun
This GitHub repository contains a simple Python program for playing a text-based game of "Snake, Water, Gun" against the computer. The game allows the player to choose from three options: Snake (s), Water (w), and Gun (g). The computer also randomly selects an option, and the program determines the winner based on the game's rules.
